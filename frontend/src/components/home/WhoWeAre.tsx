            <h4>Dream a better today, design a better tomorrow.</h4>
            <p>Dream Team Engineering is a group of engineering and non-engineering students dedicated to creating novel technologies that enhance the lives of patients at UF Health Shands, the Gainesville community, and beyond. Our team works alongside physicians, nurses, and child-life specialists to develop devices that improve patient care, support healthcare providers, and elevate the overall healthcare experience.</p>
            <p>Dream Team Engineering is organized into three branches: a design branch that uses 3D-modeling skills to build devices promoting patient education, a software branch called Dream Team Software Engineering (DTSE) that develops user-friendly medical applications, and a research branch that evaluates the effectiveness of our projects in the hospital setting. We also offer a shadowing program for freshmen and sophomores to get early exposure to the work we do.</p>
