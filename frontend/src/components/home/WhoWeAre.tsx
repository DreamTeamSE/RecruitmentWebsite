            <h3 className="h3 mb-[.5em]">Dream a better today, design a better tomorrow.</h3>
            <p className="p">Dream Team Engineering is a group of engineering and non-engineering students 
                alike that are dedicated to making novel technologies to enhance the lives 
                of the patients at UF Health Shands, the surrounding Gainesville community, 
                and beyond. Our team works alongside physicians, nurses, and child-life specialists 
                to create engineering devices that positively impact the patient, doctor, and overall healthcare experience. 
                Dream Team Engineering is currently composed of three branches: a design branch that focuses on utilizing 3D-modeling skills to build 
                devices that encourage patient education, a software engineering branch called Dream Team Software Engineering (DTSE) that leverages programming 
                skills to develop user-friendly medical applications, and a research branch that tests the efficacies of our projects being used in the hospital.
                We also have a shadowing program for freshman and sophomore students.
